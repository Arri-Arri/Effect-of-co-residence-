Abstract

Mexico is characterized by an increase in recent years in the proportion of young people leaving home before the age of 20, with the increase being more pronounced among women and mostly to enter their first union. Cohabitation has been gaining participation and has become the most predominant form of forming a first union. This increase is justified by ideational changes associated with the Second Demographic Transition, but international evidence indicates that the type of first union is related to periods of co-residence between parents and children. Using representative retrospective data on Mexican women born between 1960 and 1989 from the Encuesta Demogr√°fica Retrospectiva (EDER) of 2017, this study examines how co-residence with fathers during adolescence influences the type of first union of daughters. Discrete-time multinomial logistic regression models are used.
